## Privacy Policy for 'PAI for Wear OS'
At 'PAI for Wear OS', one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that is collected and recorded by 'PAI for Wear OS' and how we use it.

### Information Collection and Use

'PAI for Wear OS' is reading your exercises history and heart rate data, with the limitation of 90 days of history. Health information that we collect will be retained on your device and is not collected outside of the device. Data is not used for any purpose other than providing or improving the application's functionality or features. Data can only be accessed after obtaining the user's consent.

We use heart rates during exercises to compute an index of physical activity, as described in [Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI): A new standard in activity tracking for obtaining a healthy cardiorespiratory fitness level and low cardiovascular risk.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30797801/)

## Health Connect
Exercise history and heart rate data is read using Health Connect API. Health Connect user data is protected against unauthorized or unlawful access, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure.

### Data Storage
The app does store some of your data on your device to facilitate faster loading of screens and to avoid recomputing PAI and activity scores. We store only the data necessary for these purposes. Data can be deleted by the user in the settings of the app.

#### Sensitive Data Encryption and Non Disclosure
All the sensitive and personal data, including all data from Health Connect, will be stored in an encrypted database only when necessary.
All the sensitive and personal data, including all data from Health Connect, will remain unshared with any entity and will be persisted physically only within your device.
